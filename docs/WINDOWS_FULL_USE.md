# Lightpanda Full Use on Windows (Fork)

This fork now has:

- Runtime browser mode switch (`--browser_mode headless|headed`)
- Runtime viewport controls (`--window_width`, `--window_height`)
- CDP viewport controls (`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, `Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride`, `Browser.setWindowBounds`)

## 1) Check Windows prerequisites

Run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\check_lightpanda_windows_prereqs.ps1
```

If `SymlinkCreate` fails, enable Windows Developer Mode and reopen your shell.
Without symlink capability, Zig dependency unpacking can fail (`depot_tools`).
`DeveloperMode` can still show `FAIL` if symlink creation already works in your
current shell context.

## 2) Build options

1. Native Windows build:
- Works only when symlink creation is available in the current shell.
- Then run normal build commands (for example `zig build run -- help`).

2. WSL build (recommended fallback):
- Build and run from WSL where symlink behavior is reliable.
- Connect automation clients from Windows host to the WSL endpoint.

## 3) Runtime usage examples

CLI:

```powershell
.\lightpanda.exe serve --browser_mode headed --window_width 1366 --window_height 768 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9222
```

CDP viewport override:

- `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`
- `Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride`
- `Browser.setWindowBounds` with width/height

## 4) Current headed status

`headed` mode now has a native Windows window lifecycle backend:

- window open/close with page lifecycle
- native Win32 message pump on a dedicated thread
- viewport resize wiring from CLI and CDP metrics/window-bounds APIs
- native mouse (down/up/move/wheel/hwheel), click, keydown/keyup, text input (`WM_CHAR`/`WM_UNICHAR`), IME result/preedit composition messages (`WM_IME_COMPOSITION`), back/forward mouse buttons, and window blur wired into page input handling
- native key repeat state is propagated to `KeyboardEvent.repeat`
- text controls now keep insertion at the active caret/selection and support `Ctrl/Meta + A` select-all
- text controls also support word-wise keyboard editing (`Ctrl/Meta + ArrowLeft/ArrowRight`, `Ctrl/Meta + Backspace/Delete`)
- textareas now support vertical and line-aware caret movement (`ArrowUp/ArrowDown`, line-aware `Home/End`, document `Ctrl/Meta + Home/End`)
- keyboard focus traversal now supports `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` with `tabindex` ordering
- native clipboard shortcuts are wired for text controls (`Ctrl/Meta + C/X/V`, `Ctrl+Insert`, `Shift+Insert`, `Shift+Delete`)
- clipboard shortcuts dispatch cancelable `copy`/`cut`/`paste` events and respect `preventDefault()`

Graphical rendering and native input translation are still in-progress:

- frame presentation pipeline
- IME candidate/composition UI and dead-key edge cases

## 5) Route headed validation from one entrypoint

Use the validation router first when you want the smallest headed check that is
already committed on this branch:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\show_headed_validation_suites.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\show_headed_validation_suites.ps1 -ChangeArea navigation
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\show_headed_validation_suites.ps1 -ChangeArea input
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\show_headed_validation_suites.ps1 -SuiteName google-recommended
```

What exists today:

- bounded localhost probes under `tmp-browser-smoke\wrapped-link\`
- bounded localhost probes under `tmp-browser-smoke\form-controls\`
- the Windows prerequisite checker in `scripts\windows\`

What does not exist yet on this branch:

- the larger wrapper-heavy attached HTML helper chain referenced by some older notes
- a dedicated fixed-list attached bundle runner

Use the router output as the source of truth for the currently committed helper
surface.

## 6) Validate saved or attached HTML pages honestly

The saved-page compatibility path is currently a manual localhost replay rather
than a committed PowerShell wrapper. Keep the exported HTML file and any sibling
`*_files` asset directory together, serve them locally, then browse the page in
headed mode:

```powershell
cd <folder-containing-exported-html>
python -m http.server 8123 --bind 127.0.0.1
.\zig-out\bin\lightpanda.exe browse --headed --window_width 1366 --window_height 900 "http://127.0.0.1:8123/<page.html>"
```

When you already know which saved page or bundle folder you want to replay, ask
the validation router to print the same localhost steps with your concrete
input path expanded:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\show_headed_validation_suites.ps1 -ChangeArea attached-html -InputPath "<saved-html-or-folder>"
```

For the current three-page compatibility bundle, use this manual route for each
page and verify:

- the page title appears in the native window
- top-of-page controls stay clickable
- scrolling works
- text fields keep focus and accept typing
- Enter-driven submit or button activation still behaves as expected

Some older probe scripts still assume the repo checkout lives at
`C:\Users\adyba\src\lightpanda-browser`. If your checkout differs, prefer the
manual localhost route above or normalize those probe-local paths before
depending on them.
