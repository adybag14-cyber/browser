# Lightpanda Full Use on Windows (Fork)

This fork now has:

- Runtime browser mode switch (`--browser_mode headless|headed`)
- Runtime viewport controls (`--window_width`, `--window_height`)
- CDP viewport controls (`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, `Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride`, `Browser.setWindowBounds`)

## 1) Check Windows prerequisites

Run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\check_lightpanda_windows_prereqs.ps1
```

If `SymlinkCreate` fails, enable Windows Developer Mode and reopen your shell.
Without symlink capability, Zig dependency unpacking can fail (`depot_tools`).
`DeveloperMode` can still show `FAIL` if symlink creation already works in your
current shell context.

## 2) Build options

1. Native Windows build:
- Works only when symlink creation is available in the current shell.
- Then run normal build commands (for example `zig build run -- help`).

2. WSL build (recommended fallback):
- Build and run from WSL where symlink behavior is reliable.
- Connect automation clients from Windows host to the WSL endpoint.

## 3) Runtime usage examples

CLI:

```powershell
.\lightpanda.exe serve --browser_mode headed --window_width 1366 --window_height 768 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9222
```

CDP viewport override:

- `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`
- `Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride`
- `Browser.setWindowBounds` with width/height

## 4) Current headed status

`headed` mode now has a native Windows window lifecycle backend:

- window open/close with page lifecycle
- native Win32 message pump on a dedicated thread
- viewport resize wiring from CLI and CDP metrics/window-bounds APIs
- native mouse (down/up/move/wheel/hwheel), click, keydown/keyup, text input (`WM_CHAR`/`WM_UNICHAR`), IME result/preedit composition messages (`WM_IME_COMPOSITION`), back/forward mouse buttons, and window blur wired into page input handling
- native key repeat state is propagated to `KeyboardEvent.repeat`
- text controls now keep insertion at the active caret/selection and support `Ctrl/Meta + A` select-all
- text controls also support word-wise keyboard editing (`Ctrl/Meta + ArrowLeft/ArrowRight`, `Ctrl/Meta + Backspace/Delete`)
- textareas now support vertical and line-aware caret movement (`ArrowUp/ArrowDown`, line-aware `Home/End`, document `Ctrl/Meta + Home/End`)
- keyboard focus traversal now supports `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` with `tabindex` ordering
- native clipboard shortcuts are wired for text controls (`Ctrl/Meta + C/X/V`, `Ctrl+Insert`, `Shift+Insert`, `Shift+Delete`)
- clipboard shortcuts dispatch cancelable `copy`/`cut`/`paste` events and respect `preventDefault()`

Graphical rendering and native input translation are still in-progress:

- frame presentation pipeline
- IME candidate/composition UI and dead-key edge cases

## 5) Reduced Google homepage probe

Use the reduced Google probe page when issue-driven headed input work needs a
repeatable local check before moving on to the full live homepage.

1. Start a local static server from the repo root:

```powershell
python -m http.server 9582
```

2. In a second shell, watch the headed probe title stream:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\watch_headed_probe.ps1
```

Defaults:

- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:9582/src/browser/tests/page/google_home_title_probe.html`
- Expected ready marker: `BOUND|`
- Trace output: `tmp-browser-smoke\headed-probe\headed-probe-trace.json`

Useful options:

- `-LeaveOpen` keeps the headed browser running after the expected marker is seen so you can click and type manually.
- `-ExpectedTitleContains "SUBMIT:"` is useful when validating that an Enter path reaches form submission on the reduced probe.
- `-BrowserExe <path>` lets you point at a custom Windows build output.

The probe mirrors the query box state into the window title so you can track
focus, keydown, keypress, beforeinput, input, and submit behavior without
attaching a separate debugger first.
